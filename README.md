# üö¶ Smart Traffic Control System

**Traffic monitoring, vehicle & pedestrian detection, and intelligent signal management**

## üìå Project Goals

* **Detect & Count Vehicles** from live traffic camera streams using computer vision.
* **Optimize Traffic Light Timings** based on real-time data for efficient flow.
* **Enhance Safety** for pedestrians and vehicles, minimizing crash risks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### Requirements

* **Arduino IDE** installed and running.
* **Serial Monitor** in Arduino IDE should be open.
* **OpenCV** installed with all necessary dependencies.
* Configured and connected cameras for live traffic monitoring.

### Steps

1. Install Arduino IDE and ensure your microcontroller is connected.
2. Open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE.
3. Install OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`) and configure your cameras.
4. Run the traffic detection script.
